"The Book Which Tells the Truth" is a book written by Claude Vorilhon, also known as Raël, the founder of the Raëlian Movement. The book details Raël's claims of encounters with extraterrestrial beings and presents his beliefs and teachings.

According to Raël, the extraterrestrial beings he encountered revealed to him that life on Earth was created through genetic engineering by a highly advanced civilization of extraterrestrial beings, who he refers to as the Elohim. Raël claims that the Elohim created humans in their own image, and that they continue to observe and guide humanity's development.

The book presents Raël's beliefs about the nature of reality and the purpose of life. He argues that humans have a divine origin, and that our purpose is to evolve and eventually become like the Elohim, through the development of science and technology. Raël also teaches that the Elohim will return one day to bring about a new era of peace and enlightenment for humanity.

"The Book Which Tells the Truth" has been widely criticized for its claims of encounters with extraterrestrial beings, and for its teachings about the nature of reality and the purpose of life. The Raëlian Movement, which is based on the teachings presented in the book, has also been the subject of controversy, with some people claiming that it is a cult that is harmful to its members.

Despite these criticisms, the Raëlian Movement has continued to attract followers and has grown into a global organization with members in many countries. The book remains an important part of the Raëlian philosophy, and is considered by Raëlians to be a key source of knowledge and inspiration.

Overall, "The Book Which Tells the Truth" is a unique and controversial work that presents a highly unconventional view of the world and of human existence. Whether or not its claims and teachings are accepted by the wider public, the book remains an important expression of one person's vision of reality and of humanity's place in the universe.
