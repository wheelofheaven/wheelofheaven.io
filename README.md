# Wheel of Heaven | Website

This repository contains the source code for the Wheel of Heaven website, a comprehensive knowledge base exploring the hypothesis of extraterrestrial influence on Earth. The site is built using Hugo, a powerful and fast static site generator.

## Project Structure

The Wheel of Heaven website is structured as follows:

- `content/`: Contains all the markdown files which make up the content of the site. This includes articles, blog posts, and other written materials.
- `static/`: This directory hosts all static content like images, CSS files, and JavaScript files.
- `layouts/`: Holds the HTML templates that define the structure of different types of pages on the site.
- `data/`: Stores configuration files and other data files used by the site.
- `themes/`: Contains the Hugo theme used for the site. Customizations to the theme are also located here.
- `config.toml`: The main configuration file for the Hugo site. This file contains global settings for the website.
