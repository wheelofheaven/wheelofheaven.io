The Third Temple refers to a place of worship that is prophesied to be built in Jerusalem in Jewish eschatology. According to some interpretations of the Hebrew Bible and other ancient Jewish texts, the Third Temple will replace the Second Temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE. The rebuilding of the Third Temple is seen as a significant event in the Messianic age and is eagerly awaited by some Jews. There is currently no Third Temple in existence, and the exact nature and purpose of the Third Temple remains a matter of debate and speculation among scholars and religious leaders.

The rebuilding of the Third Temple remains a topic of religious and political discussion, but there has been no serious effort to begin construction. The Temple Mount, the site where the First and Second Temples were located, is currently occupied by the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, and the political and religious issues surrounding the site make it unlikely that a Third Temple will be built in the near future. Some ultra-Orthodox Jewish groups advocate for the rebuilding of the Third Temple, but their views are not representative of the wider Jewish community and face opposition from other religious and political groups.

### The Raëlian Embassy

The Raëlian Embassy is a proposed building that is part of the main tenets of the Raëlian movement. The Raëlian movement is based on the belief that extraterrestrial beings known as Elohim created life on Earth, and that they will return in the future to guide humanity to a new era of peace and harmony. The Raëlian Embassy is intended to be a physical representation of the movement's beliefs and values, serving as a hub for the promotion of Raëlian ideas and a place for members to gather and worship. The construction of the Raëlian Embassy has not yet begun, and it is unclear when or if it will be built.

### In Raëlism 🔯

According to the _Book Which Tells The Truth_, Sixth Chapter "The New Commandments", Section "Your Mission", Yahweh asks Raël and his followers to built a residence that serves as an embassy between the People of the Earth and the Elohim:

> Have a residence built in a pleasant country with a mild climate, with seven rooms always ready to receive guests, each with a separate bathroom, a conference room able to accommodate twenty-one people, a swimming pool and a dining room capable of seating twenty-one people.
>
> This residence should be constructed in the middle of a park and should be protected from curious onlookers. The park should be entirely surrounded by walls to prevent anyone from seeing the residence and the swimming pool.
>
> The residence should be situated at a distance of at least one thousand meters from the walls around the park. It will have a maximum of two stories and should be further screened from view by an inner barrier of trees and bushes. Install two entrances in the surrounding wall, one to the south and another on the northern side.
>
> The residence will also have two entrances. There will be a terrace on the roof where a spacecraft of twelve meters in diameter may land. Access from that terrace to the interior is essential.
> 
> The air space above and around the residence should not be under direct military or radar surveillance.
> 
> You will try to ensure that the area where this residence is built -if possible larger than stipulated here- is treated as neutral territory by other nations and by the nation on whose territory it is located, by virtue of it being our embassy on Earth.
