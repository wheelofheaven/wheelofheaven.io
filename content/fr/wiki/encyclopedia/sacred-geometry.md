Sacred geometry is a term used to describe the use of geometric shapes and patterns in religious and spiritual beliefs, art, architecture, and design. The idea is that the fundamental principles of geometry are reflections of the fundamental laws of the universe and that these shapes and patterns have spiritual significance.

In many cultures and traditions, sacred geometry is used to represent the interconnectedness of all things, to symbolize the divine, and to express spiritual ideas through the use of geometric shapes and patterns. For example, the circle is often seen as a symbol of unity, wholeness, and the infinite, while the square represents stability, balance, and the earth.

In architecture and design, sacred geometry is used to create harmonious and aesthetically pleasing structures, such as the use of the golden ratio in the design of buildings, sculptures, and paintings. In spirituality, sacred geometry is often used in meditation and visualization practices as a way of connecting with the divine and attaining a higher level of understanding of the universe.

Overall, sacred geometry is an ancient and cross-cultural tradition that has been used for thousands of years to express spiritual and philosophical ideas, and to create aesthetically pleasing structures and designs.

## Basic shaped ans principles

The basic shapes and principles of sacred geometry include:

- The Circle: The circle is a symbol of unity, wholeness, and the infinite, representing the cyclical nature of life, the universe, and the divine.

- The Square: The square represents stability, balance, and the earth. It is often seen as a symbol of the physical realm and material manifestation.

- The Triangle: The triangle is a symbol of change, growth, and manifestation. It can represent the creation of form from the spiritual realm to the physical realm.

- The Vesica Piscis: The Vesica Piscis is an overlapping of two circles, creating an almond-shaped figure. It is seen as a symbol of the union of the divine and the human, and the reconciliation of opposites.

- The Golden Ratio: The Golden Ratio, also known as the divine proportion, is a mathematical concept used in sacred geometry. It is a proportion that is said to be aesthetically pleasing and harmonious, and is often found in nature, art, and design.

- Spirals: Spirals are a recurring pattern in nature and are seen as symbols of growth, change, and the cyclical nature of life.

- Mandalas: Mandalas are circular diagrams or designs that are used in spiritual and meditation practices. They are often used to represent the universe and the connection between the microcosm and the macrocosm.

These are some of the basic shapes and principles of sacred geometry, which have been used in spiritual, artistic, and architectural traditions for thousands of years. The idea is that these shapes and patterns reflect the underlying structure and principles of the universe, and that they can be used to express spiritual and philosophical ideas, as well as to create harmonious and aesthetically pleasing designs.

## In historical architecture

Many historical buildings and structures have been designed with sacred geometry principles incorporated into their design. Some examples include:

- The Parthenon, Athens, Greece: The Parthenon, built in the 5th century BCE, is considered a prime example of the use of sacred geometry in ancient Greek architecture. The proportions and measurements of the temple, as well as its intricate decorations, are said to be based on the golden ratio and other sacred geometric principles.

- The Great Pyramid of Giza, Egypt: The Great Pyramid of Giza, built around 2560 BCE, is one of the most famous examples of sacred geometry in ancient architecture. The pyramid's shape and proportions, as well as its internal chambers and passageways, are said to be based on sacred geometric principles and to have spiritual significance.

- Stonehenge, England: Stonehenge, built between 3000 BCE and 2000 BCE, is an example of the use of sacred geometry in prehistoric architecture. The circular arrangement of the stones and the use of geometric patterns and shapes have been seen as expressions of spiritual and astronomical beliefs.

- Chartres Cathedral, France: Chartres Cathedral, built in the 12th and 13th centuries, is an example of the use of sacred geometry in medieval architecture. The cathedral's design, with its intricate stained glass windows and elaborate geometric patterns, is said to embody spiritual and cosmic principles.

- Hagia Sophia, Istanbul, Turkey: Hagia Sophia, built in the 6th century CE, is an example of the use of sacred geometry in Byzantine architecture. The dome of the cathedral is said to embody sacred geometric principles, and the intricate geometric patterns in its mosaics and decorations are expressions of spiritual ideas.

These are just a few examples of the many historical buildings and structures that have incorporated sacred geometry into their design. The use of sacred geometry can be found in a wide range of architectural styles and traditions, from ancient to modern times, and reflects the belief in the spiritual significance of geometric shapes and patterns.
