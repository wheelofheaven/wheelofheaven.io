The Ancient Astronaut Hypothesis proposes that in ancient times, extraterrestrial beings visited Earth and interacted with humans. Proponents of the theory suggest that evidence of these interactions can be seen in ancient art, legends, and architecture, which they claim cannot be fully explained by conventional historical and scientific explanations. They also argue that certain technological and cultural advancements in human history, such as the building of the pyramids in Egypt or the creation of the Nazca lines in Peru, could not have been achieved without outside influence.

## Historical development

The roots of the ancient astronauts hypothesis can be traced back to the 19th and early 20th centuries when people started to interpret ancient myths, religions, and artwork through the lens of the then-burgeoning field of science fiction.

- **Late 19th Century**: Early 20th Century: Authors such as H.P. Lovecraft, in his science fiction works, often mentioned the idea of ancient extraterrestrial beings influencing human history. Charles Fort, in the early 20th century, collected accounts of what he considered anomalies, many of which would later be interpreted by others as evidence of ancient astronauts.

- **1950s-1960s**: The hypothesis gained more popularity in the mid-20th century. Desmond Leslie and George Adamski's book "Flying Saucers Have Landed" (1953) suggested that ancient civilizations on Earth were influenced by extraterrestrial visitors. Erich von Däniken’s "Chariots of the Gods?" (1968) popularized the ancient astronaut theory with a wider audience. The book suggested that many ancient monuments, such as the Egyptian Pyramids or the statues on Easter Island, were built with the help of extraterrestrials.

- **1970s-1980s**: This period saw the hypothesis becoming part of popular culture, featuring in films, television series, and comic books. The "Ancient Aliens" theory, as it is now commonly known, continued to grow in popularity despite strong criticism from the scientific community.

- **1990s-Present**: Despite ongoing criticism and lack of empirical evidence, the ancient astronaut hypothesis has continued to hold a certain appeal. The History Channel's series "Ancient Aliens" (starting in 2009) has given the theory ongoing exposure to a large audience, despite widespread criticism for presenting pseudoscience as factual.

## List of proponents

Here are some of the most well-known proponents of the ancient astronaut hypothesis:

- **Matest M. Agrest (1915–2005)**: A Russian mathematician who made a number of assertions such as that the megalithic stone terracing at Baalbek had been used as a launch site for spaceships, and that the destruction of Biblical Sodom and Gomorrah were the result of a nuclear explosion detonated by extraterrestrial beings.

- **Jacques Bergier (1912–1978)**: A French writer who co-authored "The Morning of the Magicians" (1960) with Louis Pauwels, which explored various occult and paranormal topics, including the idea that ancient civilizations had contact with extraterrestrial beings.

- **Desmond Leslie (1921–2001)**: An English author who wrote "Flying Saucers Have Landed" (1953) with George Adamski, which proposed that flying saucers were piloted by extraterrestrial beings who were interested in making contact with humans.

- **Lloyd Pye (1946–2013)**: An American author and researcher who promoted the idea that humans are the result of genetic engineering by extraterrestrial beings, as outlined in his book "Everything You Know Is Wrong" (1997).

## In Raëlism 🔯

In Raëlism, the Ancient Astronaut hypothesis is interpreted as a belief that intelligent extraterrestrial beings visited Earth in the past and played a role in the development of human civilization. The Raëlian creation story suggests that life on Earth was created by extraterrestrial beings known as the Elohim, who are advanced scientists and engineers. The Elohim are described as having created humans in their own image and as having guided the development of human civilization throughout history. This interpretation of the Ancient Astronaut hypothesis is central to Raëlism and provides a framework for understanding human origins and the purpose of life on Earth.
