description: "Serpent, a metaphorical reference to an unruly faction among the Elohim (אֱלֹהִים). After the first human beings got synthetically engineered on Earth, a subset of the engineering Elohim deemed it essential to educate these new humanly creatures coequally. The education was given to the first human beings and the Elohim responsible for it, known as the Serpent, got convicted and exiled to remain on Earth for their trespassing. One of the lead protagonists of this faction is known as Lucifer, the light-bringer."

### In Raëlism 🔯

According to the _Book Which Tells The Truth_, Second Chapter, Truth, Yahweh explains how a group of engineering Elohim disobeyed and came to be known as the Serpent:

> Some scientists in this team felt a deep love for their little human beings, their "creatures", and they wanted to give them a complete education in order to make them scientists like themselves. So they told these young people who were almost adults that they could pursue their scientific studies and in so doing they would become as knowledgeable as their creators.
>
>> And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked.
>>
>> — Genesis 3: 7.
>
> The new human beings then understood that they could also become creators in their turn, and they became angry at their "parents" for having kept them away from scientific books, considering them to be like dangerous laboratory animals.
>
>> And Yahweh Elohim said unto the serpent, 'Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed... upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.'
>>
>>— Genesis 3: 14.
>
> The "serpent" was this small group of creators who had wished to tell the truth to Adam and Eve, and as a result they were condemned by the government of their own planet to live in exile on Earth, while all the other scientists had to put a stop to their experiments and leave the Earth.
