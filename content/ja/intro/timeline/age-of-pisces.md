title: "魚座の時代"
period: "紀元前 210 年—1950 年"
description: "「Wheel of Heaven」の物語における魚座の時代は、紀元前210年から1950年まで続き、牡羊座の時代に続いて水瓶座の時代に移行しました。この時代は、特にキリストの役割を含む重要な聖書の出来事に特徴づけられています。キリストの使命は、世界中に聖書の真実を広めることであり、これは科学の時代における人類の理解の基礎となるものでした。1945年に核エネルギーと情報システムの開発をもって始まる水瓶座の時代は、知識と技術的進歩が増加する時代を象徴し、人類が古代の知恵を現代的な視点で再解釈することを可能にしました。さらに、魚座の時代には、人間の母親と宇宙人から生まれた特別な子供の誕生も含まれており、独自のテレパシー能力を受け継いでおり、聖書のイエス・キリストの誕生の物語に描かれています。"

The Age of Pisces lasted from –210 BC to 1950 CE and followed the Age of Aries which lasted up to –210. This World Age just ended very recently and the transition from the Age of Pisces to the new Age of Aquarius is still being felt.

## The importance of the Biblical scriptures

> Christ’s role was to spread the truth of the biblical scriptures throughout the world, so that they could serve as proof for all of humanity when the age of science would finally explain everything.

The significance of Biblical scriptures lies in their ability to convey essential truths about our existence and the world around us. Christ's mission was to disseminate these truths globally, ensuring their preservation for future generations. In the age of science, the knowledge found in the Bible can be better understood, providing evidence and insights for humanity.

If we consider the Age of Aquarius, which began in 1945 with the development of nuclear power and the advent of information systems, to be synonymous with the age of science, several implications arise. The Age of Aquarius, which will be the main focus in the next chapter bearing the same name, is often associated with a time of increased knowledge, technology, and human potential. In this context, the age of science represents a period where humanity gains a deeper understanding of the world, enabling us to reexamine and reinterpret ancient wisdom, such as the Biblical scriptures, through a modern lens. During the Age of Aquarius, scientific advancements have led to remarkable discoveries and innovations, which have significantly shaped our understanding of the universe and our place within it. The development of nuclear power, for instance, has not only revolutionized energy production but also provided us with a glimpse into the immense power contained within the fabric of matter itself. Similarly, the arrival of information systems has transformed our ability to communicate, share knowledge, and access vast amounts of information at an unprecedented scale.
