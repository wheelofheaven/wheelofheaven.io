## Infinity in space

The concept of an infinite universe in space is based on the idea that there is no edge or boundary to the universe, and that it extends forever in all directions. This idea is supported by the observed uniformity and homogeneity of the cosmic microwave background radiation, which suggests that the universe is isotropic (the same in all directions) and homogeneous (the same at all points).

Additionally, the fact that we have not yet observed a distinct edge to the universe, despite our increasing technological capabilities and knowledge, also supports the idea of an infinite universe.

## Infinity in time

The concept of infinite time is related to the idea that time has always existed and will always exist, without any beginning or end. This idea is based on the idea that time is a fundamental aspect of the universe and cannot be created or destroyed.

In physics, the concept of time as an infinite and unchanging entity is supported by the laws of thermodynamics, which suggest that time is irreversible and that entropy (a measure of the disorder of a system) always increases over time. This suggests that the universe has a definite history and that time cannot be reversed, supporting the idea of an infinite and unchanging time.
