title: "双鱼座时代（公元前 210 年—1950 年）"
description: "《双鱼座时代》，从公元前210年持续到公元1950年，紧随金牛座时代在《Wheel of Heaven》叙述中。这个时代以特别与基督有关的重要圣经事件为标志，其使命是将圣经经文的真理传播到世界各地，为即将到来的科学时代的人类理解奠定基础。1945年开始，随着核能和信息系统的发展而开始的水瓶座时代，象征着知识和技术进步的增加的时代，使人类能够通过现代视角重新解释古代智慧。此外，双鱼座时代还包括了一个重要婴儿的诞生，出生于人类母亲和外星人之间，继承了独特的心灵感应能力，如圣经中耶稣基督诞生的故事所描绘。"

The Age of Pisces lasted from –210 BC to 1950 CE and followed the Age of Aries which lasted up to –210. This World Age just ended very recently and the transition from the Age of Pisces to the new Age of Aquarius is still being felt.

## The importance of the Biblical scriptures

> Christ’s role was to spread the truth of the biblical scriptures throughout the world, so that they could serve as proof for all of humanity when the age of science would finally explain everything.

The significance of Biblical scriptures lies in their ability to convey essential truths about our existence and the world around us. Christ's mission was to disseminate these truths globally, ensuring their preservation for future generations. In the age of science, the knowledge found in the Bible can be better understood, providing evidence and insights for humanity.

If we consider the Age of Aquarius, which began in 1945 with the development of nuclear power and the advent of information systems, to be synonymous with the age of science, several implications arise. The Age of Aquarius, which will be the main focus in the next chapter bearing the same name, is often associated with a time of increased knowledge, technology, and human potential. In this context, the age of science represents a period where humanity gains a deeper understanding of the world, enabling us to reexamine and reinterpret ancient wisdom, such as the Biblical scriptures, through a modern lens. During the Age of Aquarius, scientific advancements have led to remarkable discoveries and innovations, which have significantly shaped our understanding of the universe and our place within it. The development of nuclear power, for instance, has not only revolutionized energy production but also provided us with a glimpse into the immense power contained within the fabric of matter itself. Similarly, the arrival of information systems has transformed our ability to communicate, share knowledge, and access vast amounts of information at an unprecedented scale.

> The creators therefore decided to arrange for a child to be born of a woman of the Earth and one of their own people. The child in question would thereby inherit certain telepathic faculties, which humans lack:
